### Data sets for conducting an ignition risk assessment on the imaginary island of AtlantGIS.
The mythically lost island of Atlantis has reappeared. Beyond the Pillars of Heracles, the parable of pride and fall seems to have not yet come to an end. But the year 2022 presents the Atlantians with new challenges. The rulers of the island are confronted with recurring fires due to the changed climate. In true Platonic fashion, they recognise in these fires their prospect of atonement and now put aside pride, hubris and political grudges to join forces to secure the island's safety. 

Over the past few months, messengers have been sent out from the University of the City of Diaprepes to gather observations from all the dominions as to which natural and anthropogenic factors are relevant in the context of fire ignition. Subsequently, the brightest minds on the island were tasked with determining how to weight these factors, more specifically habitats, population density, terrain slope, road surrounding and land visibility.

In order to improve firefighting, the Atlantic rulers put all their capacities into the project of developing a risk map. They hire a young scientist to learn the latest technology to analyse the data collected for the island community. Her task is to find out how the fire ignition risk factors are distributed on AtlantGIS island. As time is of the essence, she is to derive a concrete recommendation for action for firefighting on AtlantGIS and determine which dominion area has the highest fire ignition risk.
